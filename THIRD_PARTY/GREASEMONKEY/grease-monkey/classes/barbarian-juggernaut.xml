		<description>
			<p>All barbarians draw strength from a deep fury within themselves, channeling their rage into powerful displays of raw power, strength, speed and agility. Such displays are often hindered by cumbersome, heavy plate armour, which most barbarians happily shed in favor of lighter protection, such as leather, or no protection at all. Those who follow the path of the Juggernaut, however, use the weight of heavy armour to their advantage, transforming themselves from agile hunters into unstoppable behemoths. Juggernauts hone their skills in fighting pits or gladatorial arenas, where they crush their enemies like flies against the arena walls, trampling their corpses underfoot as their thunderous momentum carries them towards their next foe.</p>
