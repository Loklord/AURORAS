			<h4>CREATING A LINGERING SOUL</h4>
			<p>As you step into the world of wandering spirits, be mindful of the circumstances that led to your demise. Fear or anger may forever be ingrained within you regarding related places or people. Vengeance drives those souls who met an unjust end at the hand of others, and your will may push you towards avenging what undue death found you. Others may remain to protect their friends as they reach a goal, leaving you to guide them along a hope you fell pursuing. What ideals keep your soul in the world of the living?</p>
			<p class="indent">This can be a challenging class, both for the player, and the Dungeon Master. Being a Lingering Soul bestows the player with a number of very useful utility features, survival techniques, and a very unique way of addressing most any combat encounter. It also can allow the continued play of a fallen character while magic to restore them is currently unavailable. However, many of these abilities can lead to dangerous circumstances if care is not taken. They also suffer from lower hit points, a general lack of armor, and the threat of looming permanent death.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a note, Lingering Souls are unable to multiclass.</p>
			
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a lingering soul quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Strength or Dexterity your highest ability score if you plan to develop into a Poltergeist. Alternatively, you could make Dexterityor Intelligence your highest ability score if you want to become a Wraith, or if becoming a Spiritual Guardian is your style, select Wisdom or Charisma. Next, invest in a higher Constitution, as healing and survival can prove tricky. Then select the background that befits your life before death.</p>
			
			
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
			<p>As a lingering soul, you gain the following class features.</p>
			<h5>HIT POINTS</h5>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Hit Dice:</strong> 1d6 per lingering soul level</li>
				<li><strong>Hit Points at 1st Level:</strong> 6 + your Constitution modifier</li>
				<li><strong>Hit Points at Higher Levels:</strong> 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per lingering soul level after 1st</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5>PROFICIENCIES</h5>
			<ul class="unstyled mb">
				<li><strong>Armor:</strong> None</li>
				<li><strong>Weapons:</strong> None</li>
				<li><strong>Tools:</strong> None</li>
			</ul>
			<ul class="unstyled">
				<li><strong>Saving Throws:</strong> Constitution</li>
				<li><strong>Skills:</strong> Choose three from History, Investigation, Insight, Intimidation, Perception, Religion, Sleight of Hand, or Stealth.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5>EQUIPMENT</h5>
			<p>You start with the following equipment your body would have on it, in addition to the equipment granted by your background, though carrying this equipment may prove difficult without aid.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a simple weapon</li>
				<li>(a) a dungeoneer’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack</li>
				<li>a trinket (rolled on the Trinkets table, PHB pg. 160)</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h5>TAKING OVER A DEAD CHARACTER</h5>
			<p>If a decceased player character returns as a Lingering Soul, they lose all previous class levels and abilities, instead returning with a number of levels in Lingering Soul equal ore less than their previous character level. They retain any languages they knew in life, as well as racial benefits and abilities, but loose all previous skill proficiencies, saving throw proficiencies, feats, and Ability Score improvements gained via class levels.</p>

			<p>Some souls that persist in the mortal realm seek a greater purpose. Whether they remain to see to some divine duty, or wish to entice or corrupt the souls of others in the name of a dark patron, it’s these spirits who invite deific guidance into their fate that begin to resemble the celestial beings or twisted fiends they worship. Relying on physical vessels to channel their fury, these guardians use their gifts to protect, herm, or influence all they encounter.</p>
			<p class="indent">Upon becoming a Spirit Guardian, choose either your Wisdom or Charisma to become your Aspect. Your Aspect modifier is equal to that of the chosen Ability Score. You gain proficiency in Charisma saving throws.</p>
