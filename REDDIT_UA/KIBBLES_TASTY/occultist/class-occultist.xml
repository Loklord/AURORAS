		<description>
			<p>Wisps of purple smoke and dancing shadows rise from the ritual as the young human woman with strange magical markings tattooed across her hands whispers words in a language long forgotten, calling forth ancient powers.</p>
			<p class="indent">The woods creak and bend, black wings beating as raven alights on the outstretch hand of an ancient elf, her eyes as black as the raven's. Soft words are spoken, and the elf nods in agreement.</p>
			<p class="indent">A young orc lets out a bellowing roar and flames burst into a form taller than an ogre causing her enemies to flee. She holds up her spear and the flames pour from the roaring fire spirit to it, swirling about it, causing it to roar alight with searing magical flames.</p>
			<p class="indent">The mysterious halfling woman gives a knowing smile, her unseeing eyes focused on you. She knows what you've come for, and tosses a handful of incense into the fire; what it is she sees in there? Your fate? Your destiny? As she speaks, it is only in riddle.</p>
			<p class="indent">Occultists those that follow the old ways, a path of ritual and wisdom long known yet oft forgotten. Rather than force magic to obey, they bind, twist, manipulate, and compromise with it. They follow ancient agreements and techniques to produce results that few fully understand, even those that use them, but they know it will work, for it always has.</p>
			
			<h4>ANCIENT TRADITIONS</h4>
			<p>Occultists are spell casters following legacies that go far back. While they may or may not be directly tutored or influence by another member of their tradition, their path to magic involves unearthing ancient secrets, old ways, and knowledge gleaned from spirits, ghosts, and elementals.</p>
			<p class="indent">The often personify aspects of their magic in ways that other casters find odd, coaxing and manipulating magic forces by ancient laws and bargains. Occultists tread between the arcane and the divine, not necessarily worshiping any god, but treating gods and spirits alike with cautious respect for their domains, asking for the what they take, and carefully giving thought to their actions.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each tradition that appears in the Occultist is an ancient legacy of magic, found deep within folklore and story. Every villager could tell you stories of Occultists and their traditions, and they are often seen in this context. Though villagers and the superstitious might fear them and their magic, they may be more likely to turn to them than a Wizard, for at least an Occultist makes sense to them, even if they are scared by their powers.</p>
			
			<h4>SPIRITUAL MAGIC</h4>
			<p>A common thread of the magic wilded by the Occultist is the spiritual connection of it; the demi-divine nature of magic that taps into the weave of magic oft through the intermediaries of the power of gods, spirits, elementals, and more. An Occultist is fundamentally tied into the greater magical world, being neither a source of magic nor an academic researcher of it, but wielding it through intuition, cunning, and tradition.</p>
			<p class="indent">Frequently an Occultist may call upon their magic through the mediums of spirits quite directly, even having names for the spirits it calls about to bring about certain magical effects; the verbal component of an Occultist spell might be the spirit they call upon to work the effect they wish, an invocation of their ancient bargain, or words in a language that binds or persuades.</p>
			
			<h4>CREATING AN OCCULTIST</h4>
			<p>When creating an Occultist, the most important decision will be what Tradition you follow. Each Tradition of an Occultist is distinct with divergent flavor and calling upon a different aspect of folklore. Do you embody the associations or defy them? What led you to this path? Did you uncover your tradition on your own or were you taught by another?</p>
			
			<h5 class="caption">QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make an Occultist quickly by following these suggestions. First, Wisdom should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution or Dexterity. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the <i>poison spray</i> and <i>produce flame</i> cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells <i>burning hands, cause fear, cure wounds</i>, and <i>tasha's hideous laughter</i>.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As a practioner of occult magic, you have inherited and developed techniques to manipulate reality through mediums of rituals, spirits, elements, and more. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the Occultist spell list.</p>
			
			<h5 class="caption">CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the Occultist spell list. You learn additional Occultist cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Occultist table.</p>
			
			<h5 class="caption">SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Occultist table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your Occultist spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell <i>witchbolt</i> and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast <i>witchbolt</i> using either slot.</p>
			
			<h5 class="caption">SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the Occultist spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Occultist table shows when you learn more Occultist spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Occultist spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Occultist spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			
			<h5 class="caption">SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Occultist spells. Your magic comes from a practitioners knowledge of traditional, ritual, and the way things work learned through experience, care and cunning. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Occultist spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier</p>
			</center>
			
			<h5 class="caption">RITUAL CASTING</h5>
			<p>You can cast any Occultist spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
			
			<h5 class="caption">SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use an occult fetish as a spellcasting focus for your Occultist spells.</p>

			<p>A Witch can be many things, and most often refers to someone that villagers find scary and weird, but at the heart of every crazed story there's a sliver of truth, and that truth is that witches do indeed exist.</p>
			<p class="indent">Some may live openly as what they are, while others may be the last person the superstitious villagers might expect. Varied in their powers, designs, and traditions based on their Coven, generalizing about a Witch is challenging, but they are most often defined by the varied utilitarian magic, hexes that make crossing them unwise, and powerful intelligent familiars.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Similar to a Holy Symbol or an Arcane Focus, an Occult Fetish is a magical focus, but one that functions for the Occultist.</p>
			<p class="indent">It can be almost anything, though usually has a somewhat macabre bent, such as a skull decorated with feathers or pendant decorated with teeth and runes.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can buy or make one for 10 gp, and it typically weighs about 1 lb.</p>

			<p>While the term Witch is generally thought of to refer to a female spell caster, the typical male counterpart would be Warlock, a class that is certainly open to any gender, and the same would generally be true for Witch.</p>
