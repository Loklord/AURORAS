		<description>
			<p>A pale dwarf, with skin cold as ice, raises his axe to meet the orc chieftan's own. The dwarf had single handedly carved a path through the orc's tribe, with a single goal on his mind. The orc hoped that the dwarf's energy would fade, and that the fight would be easy by the time he took the field, but the dwarf swung again and again, machinelike in his fury. Suddenly a blue rune lit above the dwarf's axe, and it swung with more force than ever, and the orc was unable to meet it.</p>
			<p class="indent">A man clad in black plate armor strides through the disease ridden town. Flanked by undead bodygaurds, he fears no rebuttal from the meager townsfolk. Finding a corpse ridden with boils, he reaches down to inspect it. Satisfied with the speed at which his new plague rendered the town desecrated, he ordered his thralls to hunt down survivors. There will always be new diseases to test, and new victims to test them on.</p>
			<p class="indent">Seeing her ally in danger, the elven warrior flung herself between them and the horde of goblins baring down on them. A whirling mass of bones moves to defend the pair, and tears the attacking horde asunder. Inspecting her ally's wounds, a red rune appears above her hand, and the wounds began to mend themselves. Satisfied with her work, she willed her weapon back to her. Suddenly her sword leapt from the ground, landed in her hand, and she sheathed it. It would be a long night, and there would be many more goblins ahead of them, and she'd be ready.</p>
			
			<h4>SOWERS OF DEATH</h4>
			<p>To say that a Death Knight is tied to death is to say a person is tied to food. They feel an unnatural drive to cause as much death and destruction as possible. Some fall to this desire, and become little more than monsters given mortal shell, but others focus this desire to further their goals. Be it razing the countryside, or leading a rebellion agaisnt a tyrant, death follows Death Knights wherever they go.</p>
			
			<h4>USERS OF DARK MAGIC</h4>
			<p>An edgy name and tendency to kill, are far from a Death Knights only characteristics. They channel their dark magic through runes, small symbols that appear on the Death Knights weapons, armor, or even on their skin. By expending the latent power in the runes, the Death Knights can cause a number of magical affects.</p>
			
			<h4>CREATING A DEATH KNIGHT</h4>
			<p>When creating a Death Knight, consider how you obtained your dark powers. Death Knights use ancient runic magic, little of which is known or understood. Some learn their magic from dark tomes found in a lich's lair, ancient scrolls found in some dragon's den, or some return to life with knowledge from beyond the grave. Sometimes even near death experiences can trigger memories to surface from deep within the psyche of mortal men. Regardless of their source, the dark runic magic leads to many powers that some might consider... unnatural.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Beginning at 1st level, you learn to use Runes to fuel your powers. These Runes allow you to use dark magic, and can have a variety of effects.</p>
			
			<h5 class="caption">RUNES</h5>
			<p>You start with 2 Runes, and gain more as reach higher levels, as shown in the Runes column of the Death Knight table. You can never have more Runes than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent runes on a Long Rest. You expend them on some class features and your <i>Rune Empowered Abilities</i>.</p>
			
			<h5 class="caption">RUNE EMPOWERED ABILITIES</h5>
			<p>At 1st level you learn 2 Rune Empowered Abilities of your choice from the list at the end of the class description. When you gain certain Death Knight levels, you gain additional Rune Empowered Abilities of your choice as shown in the column of the Death Knight Table. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Rune Empowered Abilities you know and replace it with another Rune Empowered Ability that you could learn at that level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Casting Spells. </i></b>Some Rune Empowered abilities allow you to cast spells, and other ask you to maintain concentration. To cast one of those spells, you use its casting time and other rules, but you don't need to provide material or somatic components for it. If an ability requires you to maintain Concentration, you must Concentrate on it as though it were a spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b><i>Saving Throws. </i></b>Some of your Rune Empowered Abilities require your target to make a saving throw to resist the attack's efects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Rune Empowered Ability Save DC </strong> = 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Constitution Modifier</p>
